# WLP-Parser: A wet lab protocol sequence tagger along with relation extraction.

This repository contains a collection of neural network models that we used to 
demostrate the utility of our dataset. These networks were trained using [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/).

A more detailed description of the wet lab protocol corpus can be found in this paper:

Additional information regarding the action, entities and relations can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00195.pdf).

Also check out a working [demo](http://bionlp.osu.edu:5000/protocols) for sequence tagging and relation extraction using the methods in this repository.
